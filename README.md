## ✨ Key Features

### MVP Features (F01-F04)

- **🤖 F01: SMS-Based AI Support** - AI-powered chatbots via SMS for seamless patient communication (MVP focus)
- **🌐 F02: Real-Time Two-Way Translation** - Instant translation between Korean and English during conversations (MVP focus)

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with SOLID principles and composition over inheritance:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one concern
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces, not modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interchangeable implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on needed abstractions
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions
